#### Brief Description of your Solution - 
An app that enables users to share their eating experiences, including food images, 
recipes, and reviews, is a social media platform designed for foodies. Users can make 
profiles, follow other users, and engage in direct messaging, comments, and likes with
one another. The site also has features like tailored recommendations, search and 
discovery, notifications, and suggestions for new events and content. The platform's 
objective is to build a community of foodies where members can interact with others who 
have similar interests, share their enthusiasm for food, and learn about new restaurants 
and cuisines
